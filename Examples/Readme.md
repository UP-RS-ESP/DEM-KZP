## Example Datasets
We provide several example DEMs. For an example on demonstrating the calibration procedure, we refer the detailed manual available at [KZ_picker_instructions_ABN_7-8-17.pdf](KZ_picker_instructions_ABN_7-8-17.pdf). This describes the calbriation and processing steps as performed by the https://github.com/UP-RS-ESP/DEM-KZP/blob/master/KZ-Picker.

An example data including calibration files is available for the the Smugglers catchment for Santa Cruz Island:

1. _smugglers_1m_dem.7z_ at [SCI-1m-Smugglers](SCI-1m-Smugglers). An example dataset at containing a 1-m DEM of the northern part of Santa Cruz Island, southern California. The example GeoTIF with calibration files are available at https://www.dropbox.com/s/kpujj3mfezzd34b/smugglers_1m.7z?dl=0 or https://boxup.uni-potsdam.de/index.php/f/38152339


Additional datasets and example - without detailed description, but with paramter files - are available here:

1. _USGS_SCI_10m_UTM11_NAD83.7z_ at [SCI-USGS-10m](SCI-USGS-10m) the USGS 10-m DEM for Santa Cruz Island with parameter files. The GeoTIF DEM is available at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/p0ow2sttn3m7tyi/USGS_SCI_10m_UTM11_NAD83.7z?dl=0 https://boxup.uni-potsdam.de/index.php/f/38195855

2. _SCI-Lidar_noveg_DTM_10m_UTM11_NAD83.7z_ at [SCI-Lidar-10m](SCI-Lidar-10m) a Lidar data (DTM, digital terrain model with vegetation removed), processed to 10m with parameter files. These data in its originral form were also used in Neely et al., 2017. The GeoTIF DEM is available at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/luac5mms70n1xwh/SCI-Lidar_noveg_DTM_10m_UTM11_NAD83.7z?dl=0 or https://boxup.uni-potsdam.de/index.php/f/38195854

3. _Pozo_DTM_noveg_UTM11_NAD83_1m.7z_ at [SCI-1m-Pozo](SCI-1m-Pozo). An example dataset at containing a 1-m DEM of the southwestern part of Santa Cruz Island, southern California. The GeoTIF DEM is available at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9judp8fy3fp4mbw/Pozo_DTM_noveg_UTM11_NAD83_1m.7z?dl=0 and https://boxup.uni-potsdam.de/index.php/f/38195891
